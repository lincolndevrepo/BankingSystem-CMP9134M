VIDEO EVIDENCE:
We're excited to share with you both the video evidence demonstrating the functionality of our program and the corresponding source code.
Due to the size limitations on GitHub, we have split the video file into smaller, more manageable chunks. Please follow the steps below to access and view the video:

Download Zip Chunks: You will find several zip files labeled as chunks (e.g., ProjectVideo.zip.001, ProjectVideo.zip.002, etc.).

Combine Chunks: Once downloaded, please ensure you have all the zip chunks downloaded onto your local machine.

Extract Zip: Use any zip extraction tool to extract the contents of the first chunk file (e.g., ProjectVideo.zip.001). This will automatically combine all the chunks into a single video file.

Watch Video: You can now watch the complete video evidence of our program in action.

The source code for our program is also available in this repository. You can access it by navigating to the respective folder or by cloning this repository to your local machine.

If you encounter any issues or have any questions regarding the video evidence or the source code, please feel free to reach out to us. We are more than happy to assist you.

SINCERELY,
